## üìçOverview

The the-dao-challenge-frontend GitHub project provides a powerful tool for creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It has been built with an array of innovative code scripts that allow developers to create an automated testing suite and customize their designs with the Tailwind CSS framework. The project enables users to vote on proposals generated by an administrator, track the current total of votes for each option, and display a confirmation message and confetti when a proposal is successfully voted on. In addition, the project allows for tracking of the window size using a custom React hook. The the-dao-challenge-frontend project provides a powerful, easy-to-use platform for users looking to build a DAO and is an invaluable resource for the Ethereum blockchain community.

| api.ts                | This code script imports axios and defines a default config for the axios instance. It then creates an axios instance with the default config and creates an api function which allows for the use of axios methods(GET, DELETE, POST, PATCH, PUT) to make requests. The api is then exported as the default.                                                                                                                            | src\api\api.ts                       |

It imports an API, declares global interfaces, and defines two types of objects, ProposalData and ProposalList. It also contains two functions, voteForProposal and fetchProposals, which respectively enable voting of proposals and fetching of proposals.                                                                                             | src\api\proposalsApi.ts              |
| apiStatus.ts          | This code script creates a type called "ApiStatus" to represent the four states of an API request(IDLE, PENDING, SUCCESS, ERROR) and a record for each of these states. It also exports a default array of all the statuses and an object containing the status values.                                                                                                                                                                  | src\api\constants\apiStatus.ts       |
| useApiStatus.ts       | This script imports and uses React's useState and useMemo hooks to create a custom hook for tracking API statuses. It defines a Statuses type, capitalizes and normalizes the statuses, and uses the hooks to prepare a list of boolean statuses which are used and returned in the custom useApiStatus hook.                                                                                                                            | src\api\hooks\useApiStatus.ts        |
| ProposalComponent.tsx | This code script creates a decentralized autonomous organization(DAO) that enables token holders to vote on proposals generated by an administrator. It imports a fetchProposals api, a withAsync helper, a useApiStatus hook, and a ProposalList component. The useFetchProposals function handles the fetching of proposals and the handleVote function handles the voting process. A button is included to view the latest proposals. | src\components\ProposalComponent.tsx |
| ProposalList.tsx      | This code script is for a React component called ProposalList which displays a list of proposals along with two options for voting on each. It also displays the current total of votes for each of those options and shows a confirmation message and confetti upon successful voting. Additionally, it displays the winning option based on the current total number of votes.                                                         | src\components\ProposalList.tsx      |
| Header.tsx            | This code script implements a Header React component which displays a title gradually character by character with a pulse animation. The title is passed in as a props, and the displayTitle state is updated every 100ms until the title is fully displayed.                                                                                                                                                                            | src\components\common\Header.tsx     |
| Paragraph.tsx         | This code script creates a React component that displays a description text, with the characters animating in one-by-one over a period of time. A timer is used to control the animation, and the interval is cleared once the description is fully displayed.                                                                                                                                                                           | src\components\common\Paragraph.tsx  |
| Spinner.tsx           | This code script creates a spinning animation by creating a div element with class names and border attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | src\components\common\Spinner.tsx    |
| test-utils.tsx        | This code script imports testing library components, @/index.css, and React. It also creates a custom renderer that wraps the React component in AllTheProviders and adds any additional options before rendering. Finally, it exports the original testing library components and the custom render method.                                                                                                                             | src\helpers\test-utils.tsx           |
| withAsync.ts          | This code script provides a function, "withAsync", which takes a function as an argument and returns a Promise of an object containing a response or an error. If successful, the response will be the result of executing the argument function, otherwise it will return an error.                                                                                                                                                     | src\helpers\withAsync.ts             |
| useWindowSize.tsx     | This code script defines a custom React hook that allows for the tracking of the current window size. Whenever a resize event is detected, the window size is updated and stored in the hook's state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | src\hooks\useWindowSize.tsx          |
